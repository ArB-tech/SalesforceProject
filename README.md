AI-Powered Sales Forecasting


**Problem Statement:**

A technology company is struggling with inaccurate sales forecasting due to inconsistent pipeline management, manual processes, and lack of predictive insights. This leads to misallocated resources, missed revenue targets, and a lack of proactive decision-making, resulting in inefficiencies across sales operations. The company needs an AI-driven solution to automate, enhance, and improve the accuracy of its sales forecasts to optimize sales strategies and resource allocation.
